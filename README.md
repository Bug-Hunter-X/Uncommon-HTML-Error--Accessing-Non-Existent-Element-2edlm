This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to DOM manipulation. The error occurs when a script attempts to access and modify a DOM element before the element has been fully added to the Document Object Model (DOM). This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, and it's a good example of a timing-related issue in JavaScript that can sometimes be difficult to troubleshoot. A simple solution to avoid this is shown in the bugSolution.html file.
